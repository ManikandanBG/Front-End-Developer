                <p>You might feel really passionate about a certain
                    type of location or setting or just be spell bound at the vast amount of things you can shoot.
                    <strong>Location shots always help to tell a story, think about what kind of story you want to tell,
                        or mood
                        you want to depict.</strong>

                    miss the
                    sense of where you are going and why. Scenery is fine - but human nature is finer.</p>
